# Safe Input Logger

Safe Input Logger is a beginner‑friendly Python program that demonstrates how to capture and store user input in a controlled environment. Unlike malicious keyloggers, this script does **not** monitor system‑wide keystrokes. Instead, it records only the text that a user voluntarily types into the program, making it a safe and ethical way to explore the concept of logging.

## Features
- Accepts user input directly from the terminal  
- Saves each entry into a text file (`input_log.txt`)  
- Displays confirmation of what has been logged  
- Provides a clean exit option by typing `exit`  

---

## Purpose
This project is designed for learners interested in:
- Practicing **Python basics** (loops, file handling, user input)  
- Understanding **logging concepts** in a safe way  
- Building a simple project for a **portfolio or GitHub showcase**  
- Exploring ethical hacking fundamentals without unsafe code  

---

##  Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/safe-input-logger.git
   cd safe-input-logger
   - Run the script:
python3 safe_input_logger.py
- Type any text at the prompt. Each line will be saved to input_log.txt.
Type exit to stop the program.
- View the log file:
cat input_log.txt



 Learning Value
This project is ideal for:
- Students building a portfolio of simple security tools
- Beginners practicing Python with a real‑world example
- Ethical hacking learners who want to understand logging without deploying unsafe keyloggers
